# My Portfolio

This portfolio template was a open source repository that I gained from https://github.com/MarcusVirg/forty and https://github.com/laderast/portfolio-example which is a template for sharing work as an online portfolio (website).


The template portfolio is a simple example built with [`hugo`](https://gohugo.io) 
derived from the [`forty`](https://themes.gohugo.io/forty/) theme. 

To see a website using this template, 
check out this example: https://hugo-portfolio-example.netlify.app/
